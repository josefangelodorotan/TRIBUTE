      <h3 class="second"> Early Life and High School Basketball Career</h3>
      <p class="second"> Lebron James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio. At an early age, James showed a natural
        talent for basketball. He was recruited by St. Vincent-St. Mary High School to join their basketball team in
        1999.
        Overall, James scored 2,657 points, 892 rebounds and 523 assists during his four years there.

        As a freshman, James averaged 18 points per game. He helped the team to a Division III state title by scoring 25
        points in the championship game. Word of his advanced basketball skills spread, and James received several
        honors
        for his performance.

        As a high school sophomore, James was chosen for the USA Today All-USA First Team. He was the first sophomore
        ever
        selected for this award. His team also won the Division III state title for the second year in a row.

        The following school year, James was named PARADE magazine's High School Boys Basketball Player of the Year and
        Gatorade Player of the Year. Following the end of his junior year, James was such a strong player that he
        contemplated going pro.

        Deciding to finish his education, James had a tremendous senior year on the court. He averaged 31.6 points per
        game, helping his team clinch their third state title. The St. Vincent-St. Mary High School team also earned the
        top national ranking that year. James would soon emerge as one of the National Basketball Association's leading
        players.</p>
